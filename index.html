<div id="instructions">Use the arrow keys to move left, move right, and jump. Use the spacebar to toggle between day mode and night mode. Some platforms are transparent; toggle modes to access them! Permanent platforms (distinguished by) are available in both modes. Reach the door at the end of each level while avoiding spikeyballs. The purple gems give you floaty powers. Red gems return you to normal. You'll need some of the gems, while avoiding others. Have fun!</div>
