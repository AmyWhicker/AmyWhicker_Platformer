<div id="instructions">Reach the door at the end of each level while avoiding spikeyballs. You don't need to collect every gem. Use the arrow keys to move left, move right, and jump. <b>Use the spacebar to toggle between day mode and night mode.</b> Some platforms are transparent; toggle modes to access them! Some platforms are permanent (available in both modes). The purple gems give you floaty powers. Red gems return you to normal (and some need to be avoided). Have fun!</div>
